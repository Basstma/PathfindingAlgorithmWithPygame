## How to use

For starting the Search Algorithm Visualisation first start the bin.py.
This creates an object from class Controll. 
This class starts the management GUI. There an user have the change to set size, delay and the scale of the builded maze.
If this is happened the algorithms for creation and enclosing for visualisation can be started

## Configuration GUI

1. Size:
Size is the configuration of the x and y length of the array.
   
2. Scale: Scale scales one array point in the pygame window. If one point p is a value in the Array for the maze
in pygame it has the size 1 * scale for x and y length in the pygame display maze.

3. Delay: Delay is the time between to steps in an algorithm. It makes it easieser to
follow the steps that are used in creation and searching.
   
## Needed Python Libraries
